# Recommender-System
This directory has programs that were build for recommender system
There are three main paradigms in recommender systems

1. Collaborative Filtering - What have my peers liked?

2. Content Based Filtering - What have I liked?

3. Hybrid - Mix of both


In Collaborative Filtering, there are two main types:
1. User-based collaborative filtering

  a. Find users who have same rating pattern with the user of interest.
  
  b. Use rating from those list of users to recommend the item to the user of interest.
  
  c. The drawback of this method is that user's choice can be volatile.
  
2. Item-based collaborative filtering

  a. Build Item-User-Rating matrix.
  
  b. Create a correlation with the user's rating vector with the other items.
  
  c. Recommend items with high correlation.
  
  d. It is also called as model based collaborative filtering.
